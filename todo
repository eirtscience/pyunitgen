  ☐ Generate Python unit test automatically @started(20-05-27 17:51)

  New:
    ✔ Create a function to get all the python files from the given folder. @started(20-05-27 17:49) @1h30m @done(20-05-27 18:52) @lasted(1h3m36s)
      ✔ Loop through the each directory and get each file. @done(20-05-27 18:52)
    ✔ Create a function to get python class, method and function from each file.: @done(20-07-30 20:46)
      ✔ For each python class @done(20-07-30 20:46)
      ✔ For each python class method @done(20-07-30 20:46)
    Create a function to generate the unittest for each class,method and function.:
      ✔ Create a function to get all the annotation for each class,method and function @done(20-08-01 01:41)
      ✔ Create a function to use faker to generate the unittest data @done(20-08-01 01:41)

    ✔ Add file module import when generating the file. @done(20-08-01 01:41)

    Add a report when the following are missings:
      ☐ comment to a function or methods
      ☐ return type is different than the pyunitgen annotation definition
      ☐ how long the current implementation took to run
      ☐ the type of the algorithm used for the current implementation

    ☐ Add an email sender so the application can send an email with a report.

    ☐ Make sure to use the compile and exec to exec any function or method to determine it return value in case there is no annotation

    Make sure to handler the following error:
      ✔ ModuleNotFoundError @done(20-08-01 23:35)
      ☐ ImportError
      ☐ AttributeError
      
    ✔ Allow the application to generate a unittest for a single file input not only a directory. @done(20-08-02 01:34)

    ✔ When the watching folder has been changes, instead of recompiling all the files one by one ,track the file that has been change and only generate the unittest code for it. @done(20-08-03 07:57)

    When generating a unittest for the provide module folder:
      ☐ Check if that folder contain a __init__.py file
      ☐ If not created.

    ☐ Add a handler whenerver the application find 'apiParam' replace by the current function/method parameter
      
  
  Bugs:
      ✔ There is a duplicate class generation when the file contains only a functions @done(20-08-01 01:42)
      ✔ Cannot get the class __init__ parameters @done(20-08-01 16:21)
      ☐ There are some issues with a simple function unitest generation , please fixe it.
